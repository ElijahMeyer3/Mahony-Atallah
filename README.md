# Mahony-Atallah

At a big picture level, my hope is that this dataset can support a foundation paper that clarifies how to interpret change over time in strengths based, preventive initiatives that are intentionally low burden and designed for broad reach. Because the initiative was not intended to function as an evidence-based intervention, the primary goal of the paper is not to evaluate efficacy, but rather to understand what patterns of change look like in this context and how timing of change, variability in response, and baseline characteristics can be interpreted responsibly.

More specifically, I am hoping the paper can demonstrate whether the data allow us to meaningfully examine change across the three waves, assess whether the timing of change aligns with the delayed start structure, and describe how students differ in their response to the initiative. I am also interested in whether baseline character strengths profiles can be used in a light, interpretive way to help contextualize these different response patterns, rather than as outcomes or mechanisms of change. My goal is not to push the data beyond what they can support, but to be clear and defensible about what conclusions are reasonable given the design and measures.

This paper is intended to serve as a starting point for a broader line of work I am building. I am currently running a parallel strengths based initiative with faculty, and I have longer term plans to develop a flexible strengths toolkit that can be used across roles within educational systems. My hope is that this undergraduate paper helps establish the interpretive and analytic logic that can then be examined, refined, and extended in those future contexts, rather than having each study stand alone.

I have included a secure link (LINK) to the folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DZISA431tocwJJjycTsDNLU0HHKL3cGH. 

The main longitudinal dataset contains all outcome data for the project, with a brief codebook included on the second tab. Each participant has a row for each time wave, with pre intervention, mid intervention (1M), and post intervention (1P) observations. The primary outcomes collected across all three waves include overall life satisfaction (SWLS), college life satisfaction (CCSWQ), positive affect (PANAS_Pos), negative affect (PANAS_Neg), and self-compassion (SCS). Baseline character strengths data, including Top 5 strength profiles for each participant, are included in a separate file within the same folder.

I would really value your perspective on whether the data are well suited to these goals and what you see as the strongest and most appropriate analytic possibilities given the constraints. Once you have had a chance to look things over, I would love to find a time to connect and hear your thoughts.
